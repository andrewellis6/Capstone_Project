# Office Hours

Office hours are held in Classroom 4. At least one instructor will be present. They're completely optional, but can be **extremely** useful!

**Tuesday:** 5PM-6PM (Nichole)

**Wednesday:** 5PM-7PM (Riley)

**Thursday:** 5PM-6PM (Nichole)

(These are subject to change but every attempt will be made to notify you ahead of time about any changes.)

The format is informal: the instructor "on duty" hangs out by the student work area, and if you get stuck, you can wander over and ask him/her a question. If everyone is having the same problem, the instructor may conduct an informal mini-lesson.
