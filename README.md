# DSI+ 2

Welcome to DSI+!  If this is your first time, here are a few first steps for you to start with.

It's important that you've completed the following before doing anything:
1. Completed your [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) pre-work (the 8 required modules).
1. Created a [GitHub Enterprise](http://git.generalassemb.ly) and [Github](http://www.github.com) account. Make sure to set-up an account and add a photo.
1. Download and install [Slack](http://www.slack.com).  
_Check your mail for the invite to the ga-students.slack.com team. Update your profile under “Profile & Account” so that it includes your actual name and which General Assembly Campus you are attending (ex: John Smith attending class in LA would put First Name: John Last Name: Smith (LA)._
1. Opened an account with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
1. Completed the [technology survey](https://goo.gl/forms/eAVWUaIigClCYrP52) so we know how to support you.

## Day 0: Lessons

The first lessons we will delivering will be related to the command line.  You simply need to clone these repo's containing our lesson material here:

* [Tools: The Command Line](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-plus-2/tools-command_line-lesson)
* [Tools: Intro to Git](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-plus-2/tools-git_intro-lesson)
* [Pyton: Descriptive Statistics with Numpy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-plus-2/python-descriptive_statistics_numpy-lesson)

Much of what we will be going over on 0 Day will be driven from our [wiki](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-plus-2/dsi-plus-home/wiki).

## Main Wiki

Class information will be located on the [main wiki](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-plus-2/dsi-plus-home/wiki) associated with this _dsi-plus-home_ repo.

Here you will find:
- Daily schedules
- Project guidelines
- Walkthroughs and cheatsheets
- Campus information
- Extra resources

Take the time to bookmark the wiki now. You will be using it everyday.

## FAQ

<details><summary>Q: How do I get lesson material?</summary><p>


A: We will be using Github Enterprise (http://git.generalassemb.ly)!
Material once it's avaiable, can be found in our [DSI-plus-2 Org](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-plus-2/).  You will want to clone these repositories if you would like to keep a copy for yourself (this is recommended).  During instruction, these resources will be used by instructors during lectures.  It's also great to be able to keep a copy for yourself, take notes, make updates, etc.  We will be going over in class how this works for the first few days.

It's recommended that you fork any lessons to your own repo, then clone them to your workspace for every new lesson or lab repo as they are available.  To get a head start on learning Git/Github, you can check out [try.github.com](http://try.github.com)
</p></details>

<details><summary>Q: Do I need to setup my own development environment?</summary><p>


A: On your first day, no.

It's nice to have one but we will show you how to setup Docker and also use Anaconda within the first few weeks.
</p></details>

<details><summary>Q: Can I schedule time with an instructor?</summary><p>


A: Check out the [front page of our wiki](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-west-3/course-info/wiki) to schedule 1:1's.

</p></details>

<!-- and/or you haven't even setup your data science development environment, follow the following steps:


# 1. Setup your AWS instance, security profile, and Docker image / container

[AWS Docker Setup](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-west-3/course-info/wiki/AWS-Docker-Setup)

We will be using an AWS instance, which is a virtual machine that runs in a cloud environment, as the main resource for running in class material and generally working with Python and statistical learning libraries (ie: scikit-learn, statsmodels).

# 2. Create your GA Github Enterprise account

You may have a regular Github account but we will be using Github Enterprise, which has many more features, but most importantly, it's how we will be sharing and collaborating all of our class materials.

Follow this guide:
[Student Github Enterprise Setup](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-west-3/course-info/wiki/Student-Github-Enterprise-Setup)

**Some helpful links to get you started:**
* [Main wiki](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dsi-west-3/course-info/wiki) - Office hours, AWS Setup
