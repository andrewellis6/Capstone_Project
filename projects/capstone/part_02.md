# Part 2

Due: November 15, 2017

### Overview

In this section you will provide a thorough outline of your project, including the goal of your predictive model and the data you will use to explore that model. 

**Goal**: A Jupyter Notebook outlining your project's goals, methods, models, and EDA.

### Requirements

We expect a formatted and complete Jupyter Notebook by EOD on November 15, 2017 which accomplishes the following:

- Articulates the main goal of your project
- Outlines your proposed methods and models
- Defines the risks & assumptions of your data 
- Revises initial goals & success criteria, as needed
- Performs & summarizes the EDA of your data

**Note**: We expect you to have your data in hand by this point and to have completed some EDA. Having your data ready to go sets you up for success in the remaining three portions of the Capstone Project. 

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

 - Materials must be presented in a Jupyter Notebook stored within a repository on your personal (*not* GA) GitHub
