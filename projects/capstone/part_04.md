# Part 4

## Overview 

The final week is here and we could not be happier to see your projects taking shape! The final two portions of the Capstone project are detailed presentation of the technical and non-technical portions of your Capstone. In Part 4, we expect a detailed account of your final model and the choices and assumptions that you made during your modeling process targeted at a fellow Data Scientist. We also expect a near-final version of your code (accepting that of course, various tweaks may occur afterwards).

_Goal_: A technical report and submission of (near-)final modeling code

---

## Requirements

You are expected to submit the following (on your public Github account) by EOD December 18, 2017:

- A technical report on your modeling choices and assumptions written for a fellow Data Scientist
- A (near-)final version of your code

### Format

Your code and technical report may be in any format you choose, provided that it is clear what to look at. We will expect it to be very easy to find what version of your code is the correct one (that is why we are using version control, of course!) and where your technical report is. If it is not clear, make sure that it is or that we are informed of where to look.

### Technical Report

You can imagine your technical report as a primer or recipe on how to replicate your modeling process. Length and format are up to you (though something roughly the length and tone of your executive summaries from Project 4 would be a great starting point). At a minimum, your technical report should contain:

1. How you acquired your data (including any sampling that you did)
2. How the data should be transformed, including justifying your choices
3. How you operationalized your outcome variable, including your justification
4. Your choice of model and any hyperparameters, including what metric or metrics you use to determine a successful model
5. Any future deployment strategies, additions of data, or modeling techniques you have yet to try

In other words, another Data Scientist should be able to take your techncial report and, without seeing your code, come up with a similar model.

### Code

Your code may be structured in any way you choose (though obviously, efficient and well-written code is preferred!) At this point in the process you should have your models finalized for the most part, this is to confirm your code is at a good point.

## Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Your code and technical report posted to your personal GitHub and linked to us no later than EOD December 18, 2017.
