# Part 5

## Congratulations!

Welcome to the final day and final submission for DSI-EAST-1! It has been a long road and a challenging 3 months, but welcome to your final stop: the presentation!

## Deliverable

You will present your project and findings in a 12 minute presentation on December 20, 2017! You should expect the members of your audience to be non-technical in nature. Your presentation should provide a summary of your problem, your approach to modeling that problem, and your ultimate findings. 

## Things to Keep in Mind

- You will have exactly 12 minutes (and no more!) to present your findings. Make sure your presentation falls within those lines!
- Your presentation should focus on summarizing your question, your approach, your findings, and how it might be used in the future.
- You will not be able to present every facet of your work, so please do not try to do that! Instead, try and identify the most salient points of your project and show those off instead. 
- Particularly when presenting to a non-technical audience, remember that what and why can be much more interesting than how:
  - What are you trying to predict?
  - Why are you doing it?
  - What are some predictions your model has made?
  - What will you use it for in the future
- Note, not _how_ did you pick your model type or _how_ did you choose your hyperparameters (in fact, usually better to keep hyperparameters just to us data scientists!) 
- Have _fun_! This is a celebration of the 12 weeks of hard work that you have done!

## Requirements

One 12 minute presentation given to your fellow classmates and well-wishers. You will have 12 minutes for your presentation (warnings given at 5 and 1 minutes) and 5 additional minutes for questions from the audience.
