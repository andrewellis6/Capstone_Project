## Important Dates
  * **3/13 - 3/17** SXSW 

## Communication
  - You have been invited to the following Slack teams:
    - [GA Immersive Students](https://ga-students.slack.com)
      - [#wdi-atx-10](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-atx-10/)
      - [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/)
    - [GA ATX Alumni](https://atx-alumni.slack.com) - Austin WDI Alumni (You will be invited end of course)
  - For informal communication that doesn't need to be private, use the #wdi-atx-10 room
  - If you need to talk to the instructors privately, use the Slack rooms we're creating for you with each of the instructors in it. Please don't Slack or email the instructors individually as this creates information asymmetry.

## Slack Tips

- <code>&grave;hello&grave;</code>: Backticks (the top-left of the keyboard on a Mac) makes text show up in a monospace font. Great for code.
- Code blocks are made with three backticks:
  <pre>
  &grave;&grave;&grave;
  The backticks MUST be on a line by themselves!
  &grave;&grave;&grave;
  </pre>
- You can specify the language directly after the backticks to have colors show up on github
  <pre>
  &grave;&grave;&grave;javascript
    var words = ["hello", "what", "is", "up", "dude"];
  &grave;&grave;&grave;
  </pre>
- These same backtick tricks also work on **GitHub** and **Slack**.
- `@here`: Sends a message to everyone currently online in a Slack room
