    "Despite being the richest country in the world, America ranks barely above average in reading and science, and below average in math according to the PEW Research center. My goal is to use public data from Massachusetts to idenitfy what features lead to high student outcomes. I chose this dataset from Kaggle because it was pre-merged and had over 300 features that I could analyze. However, after doing some initial EDA, I realized that there was still a significant amount of data-cleaning that needed to happen if I was going to run models that would give me proper insight. I am wondering what superintendents can do to turn around a school district."
