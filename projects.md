# Projects

Across your time in DSI-EAST-1, you'll be expected to successfully complete five projects. Information on those projects, their submission dates, and relevant code can be found below.

Four of these projects are one-off submissions designed to track your progress through the course and comprehension of the material. The final Capstone Project is a much larger undertaking and has several intermediate steps due along the way.

## Expectations

These projects are designed to offer you the opportunity to further develop your skills as Data Scientists. They are typically more open-ended and deliberately a little sparse in terms of expectation -- this is by design. In many ways, what you get out of each project should be a reflection of what you put in (the old adage of "Practice Makes Perfect" is very fitting here!)

Realistically, this means that your projects have two competing goals. The first is to create work with a relatively high level of polish and quality, similar to what you would be expected to generate on site as a Data Scientist. The second, however, is to give you the space to explore and experiment and get things _wrong_ without having a job or a business on the line. To that end, I offer the following points of advice:

1. Don't be afraid to try something new or to be unsuccessful in trying something -- experimentation is very frequently the way we acquire new skills as Data Scientists
2. Document what you've done (and particularly whether it has worked or not)
3. Be deliberate in how you spend your time. It can be very easy to get lost in trying to get one small piece of code to work (those of you who have played the Civilization video game series might recognize this as "One More Turn..." syndrome!) Periodically step back, remind yourself of the larger goals of the project, and assess whether your time is being spent well.
4. Related to point 3, be your own best project manager! Our field typically has a number of moving parts -- organization can be key to successful submissions. 
5. Be ruthless in deleting code that does not work, that is commented out, or attempts that have not borne fruit. If you're hanging onto something because you might need it later, commit it to git and delete it (and now, you can go back any time and resurrect it!)

## Starting Out

Here are some good tips when starting out on a new project (particularly for the first four):

0. Fork this repository to your namespace (`richardharris/course-info` instead of `DSI-EAST-1/course-info`)
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Create a new branch for your work (`git checkout -b NAMEOFBRANCH`)
3. Create a new directory inside the submissions folder for your work (`mkdir project_x/submissions/YOURNAMEHERE`)
4. Read through the readme in each project, making sure that you are clear on what the expectations for each project are

## Submission Dates

Check `course-info/README.md` (main document in this repository)!

## Submission Process

Unless otherwise stated, please keep in mind the following when submitting work:

- Your work is expected at end of day on the due date (though early submissions are always welcome!)
- Create your own branch on the forked repo for each of your projects
- Please submit your code as a Python script (`.py`) or as a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- If your work includes a write-up or discussion of your findings, please include those in your submission folder (write-ups are _strongly encouraged_ to be Markdown files, but not strictly required)
- When submitting your work, issue a pull request into `master` from the branch containing your work. Inside the pull request, note where any key files are (such as your write-up) if they are not immediately apparent. 

## Assessment 

You should expect written feedback on your work within a week of submission as well as some guidelines on different elements of the project.  We will be looking at your work holistically and, in general, assessing the following:

- Were the main goals of each project met?
- Was your code well-written and able to be successfully ran?
- Did your work show a generally high level of professionalism and polish?
